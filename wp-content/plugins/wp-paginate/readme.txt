== Description ==

WP-Paginate is a simple and flexible pagination plugin which provides users with better navigation on your WordPress site.

In addition to increasing the user experience for your visitors, it has also been widely reported that pagination increases the SEO of your site by providing more links to your content.

Starting in version 1.1, WP-Paginate can also be used to paginate post comments!

Translations: http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/wp-paginate/I18n (check the version number for the correct file)
	
== Installation ==

*Install and Activate*

1. Unzip the downloaded WP-Paginate zip file
2. Upload the `wp-paginate` folder and its contents into the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation
3. Activate WP-Paginate from Plugins page

*Implement*

For posts pagination:
1) Open the theme files where you'd like pagination to be used. Depending on your theme, this may be the `loop.php` file or the `index.php`, `archive.php` and `search.php` files. The `twentyeleven` theme places the pagination code in `functions.php` in the `twentyeleven_content_nav()` function.

2) Replace your existing `previous_posts_link()` and `next_posts_link()` code block with the following:

	<?php if(function_exists('wp_paginate')) {
		wp_paginate();
	} ?>

For the `twentyeleven_content_nav` theme, the new function would look like:

	function twentyeleven_content_nav( $nav_id ) {
		global $wp_query;

		if ( function_exists( 'wp_paginate' ) ) {
			wp_paginate();
		}
		else {
			if ( $wp_query->max_num_pages > 1 ) : ?>
				<nav id="<?php echo $nav_id; ?>">
					<h3 class="assistive-text"><?php _e( 'Post navigation', 'twentyeleven' ); ?></h3>
					<div class="nav-previous"><?php next_posts_link( __( '<span class="meta-nav">&larr;</span> Older posts', 'twentyeleven' ) ); ?></div>
					<div class="nav-next"><?php previous_posts_link( __( 'Newer posts <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span>', 'twentyeleven' ) ); ?></div>
				</nav><!-- #nav-above -->
			<?php endif;
		}
	}


For comments pagination:
1) Open the theme file(s) where you'd like comments pagination to be used. Usually this is the `comments.php` file.

2) Replace your existing `previous_comments_link()` and `next_comments_link()` code block with the following:

	<?php if(function_exists('wp_paginate_comments')) {
		wp_paginate_comments();
	} ?>


*Configure*

1) Configure the WP-Paginate settings, if necessary, from the WP-Paginate option in the Settings menu

2) The styles can be changed with the following methods:

* Add a `wp-paginate.css` file in your theme's directory and place your custom CSS there
* Add your custom CSS to your theme's `styles.css`
* Modify the `wp-paginate.css` file in the wp-paginate plugin directory

*Note:* The first two options will ensure that WP-Paginate updates will not overwrite your custom styles.

*Upgrading*

To 1.1.1+:

* Update WP-Paginate settings, change `Before Markup` to `<div class="navigation">`
* Update `wp-paginate.css`, change `.wp-paginate ol` to `.wp-paginate`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I override the default pagination settings? =

The `wp_paginate()` and `wp_paginate_comments()` functions each takes one optional argument, in query string format, which allows you to override the global settings. The available options are:

* title - The text/HTML to display before the pagination links
* nextpage - The text/HTML to use for the next page link
* previouspage - The text/HTML to use for the previous page link
* before - The text/HTML to add before the pagination links
* after - The text/HTML to add after the pagination links
* empty - Display before markup and after markup code even when the page list is empty
* range - The number of page links to show before and after the current page
* anchor - The number of links to always show at beginning and end of pagination
* gap - The minimum number of pages before a gap is replaced with an ellipsis (...)

You can even control the current page and number of pages with:

* page - The current page. This function will automatically determine the value
* pages - The total number of pages. This function will automatically determine the value

Example (also applies to `wp_paginate_comments()`):

	<?php if(function_exists('wp_paginate')) {
		wp_paginate('range=4&anchor=2&nextpage=Next&previouspage=Previous');
	} ?>


= How can I style the comments pagination differently than the posts pagination? =

When calling `wp_paginate_comments()`, WP-Paginate adds an extra class to the `ol` element, `wp-paginate-comments`.

This allows you to use the `.wp-paginate-comments` styles, already in `wp-paginate.css`, to override the default styles.
