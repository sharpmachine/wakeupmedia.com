== 404 Monitor ==

= Overview =

* **What it does:** The 404 Monitor keeps track of non-existent URLs that generated 404 errors. 404 errors are when a search engine or visitor comes to a URL on your site but nothing exists at that URL.

* **Why it helps:** The 404 Monitor helps you spot 404 errors; then you can take steps to correct them to reduce link-juice loss from broken links.

* **How to use it:** Check the 404 Monitor occasionally for errors. (A numeric bubble will appear next to the "404 Monitor" item on the menu if there are any newly-logged URLs that you haven't seen yet. These new URLs will also be highlighted green in the table.) If a 404 error's referring URL is located on your site, try locating and fixing the broken URL. If moved content was previously located at the requested URL, try using a redirection plugin to point the old URL to the new one.

If there are no 404 errors in the log, this is good and means there's no action required on your part.

= Log Help =

You can perform the following actions on each entry in the log:

* The "View" button will open the URL in a new window. This is useful for testing whether or not a redirect is working.
* The "Google Cache" button will open Google's archived version of the URL in a new window. This is useful for determining what content, if any, used to be located at that URL.
* Once you've taken care of a 404 error, you can click the "Remove" button to remove it from the list. The URL will reappear on the list if it triggers a 404 error in the future.

= Settings Help =

The following options are available on the Settings tab:

* **Monitoring Settings**
	
	* **Continue monitoring for new 404 errors** -- If disabled, 404 Monitor will keep existing 404 errors in the log but won't add any new ones.
	
* **Log Restrictions**

	* **Only log these types of 404 errors** -- Check this option to log a 404 error _only_ if it meets at least one of the criteria you specify. If you don't enable any criteria, no 404 errors will be logged.
	
		* **404s generated by search engine spiders** -- When logging restriction is enabled, this option will make an exception for 404 errors generated by one of the top search engines (Google, Yahoo, Baidu, Bing, Yandex, Soso, Ask.com, Sogou, or AltaVista).
		* **404s with referring URLs** -- When logging restriction is enabled, this option will make an exception for 404 errors generated by users who click a link on your site or another site first before ending up at a 404 page on your site.

* **Maximum Log Entries** -- Here you can set the maximum number of log entries that 404 Monitor will keep at a time. Setting this to a reasonable number will help keep database usage under control. If you change this setting, it will take effect the next time a 404 is logged.

* **URLs to Ignore** -- URLs entered here will be ignored whenever they generate 404 errors in the future. You can use asterisks (*) as wildcards.

= Troubleshooting =

404 Monitor doesn't appear to work? Take these notes into consideration:

* The 404 Monitor doesn't record 404 errors generated by logged-in users.
* In order for the 404 Monitor to track 404 errors, you must have "Pretty Permalinks" enabled under `Settings > Permalinks`.
* Some parts of your website may not be under WordPress's control; the 404 Monitor can't track 404 errors on non-WordPress website areas.



== Canonicalizer ==

= Overview =

* **What it does:** Canonicalizer improves on two WordPress features to minimize possible exact-content duplication penalties. The `<link rel="canonical" />` tags setting improves on the canonical tags feature of WordPress 2.9 and above by encompassing much more of your site than just your posts and Pages.

	The nonexistent pagination redirect feature fills a gap in WordPress's built-in canonicalization functionality: for example, if a URL request is made for page 6 of a category archive, and that category doesn't have a page 6, then by default, depending on the context, WordPress will display a blank page, or it will display the content of the closest page number available, without issuing a 404 error or a 301 redirect (thus creating two or more identical webpages). This duplicate-content situation can happen when you, for example, remove many posts from a category, thus reducing the amount of pagination needed in the category's archive. The Canonicalizer's feature fixes that behavior by issuing 301 redirects to page 1 of the paginated section in question.

* **Why it helps:** These features will point Google to the correct URL for your homepage and each of your posts, Pages, categories, tags, date archives, and author archives. That way, if Google comes across an alternate URL by which one of those items can be accessed, it will be able to find the correct URL and won't penalize you for having two identical pages on your site.

* **How to use it:** Just check both checkboxes and click Save Changes. SEO Ultimate will do the rest.



== Code Inserter ==

= Overview =

* **What it does:** Code Inserter can add custom HTML code to various parts of your site.

* **Why it helps:** Code Inserter is useful for inserting third-party code that can improve the SEO or user experience of your site. For example, you can use Code Inserter to add Google Analytics code to your footer, Feedburner FeedFlares or social media widgets after your posts, or Google AdSense section targeting code before/after your content.
	
	Using Code Inserter is easier than editing your theme manually because your custom code is stored in one convenient location and will be added to your site even if you change your site's theme.

* **How to use it:** Just paste the desired HTML code into the appropriate fields and then click Save Changes.

=  Troubleshooting =

* **Why doesn't my code appear on my site?** It's possible that your theme doesn't have the proper "hooks," which are pieces of code that let WordPress plugins insert custom HTML into your theme. [Click here](http://johnlamansky.com/wordpress/theme-plugin-hooks/) for information on how to check your theme and add the hooks if needed.


== Competition Researcher ==

= Overview =

* **What it does:** The Competition Researcher opens Google search results in iframes based on the parameters you specify. The Competition Researcher does _not_ scrape/crawl Google's search results or use other illicit automated methods; it just opens the Google search results in your browser.

	The Competition Researcher lets you find out the following information:
	* How many webpages are competing for the keywords you specify.
	* The keyword relevance in competing webpages' titles, body content, or anchor text.
	* How many pages of a competing website are in Google's index.
	* The incoming links profile of competing websites.
	* The external websites that your competitors are linking to.

* **Why it helps:** The Competition Researcher gives you quick access to specially-constructed search queries. You can study the search results to glean information about the general competition for specific keywords or information about specific competitors' websites. Knowledge of the competition is an essential component of any SEO strategy.

* **How to use it:** Choose a tool based on the information you'd like to obtain, enter the keywords or competitors' domain names that you'd like to research, select options if desired, and then click Submit. The results will open in a new window.



== File Editor ==

= Overview =

* **What it does:** The File Editor module lets you edit two important SEO-related files: robots.txt and .htaccess.

* **Why it helps:** You can use the [robots.txt file](http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html) to give instructions to search engine spiders. You can use the [.htaccess file](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/htaccess.html) to implement advanced SEO strategies (URL rewriting, regex redirects, etc.). SEO Ultimate makes editing these files easier than ever.

* **How to use it:** Edit the files as desired, then click Save Changes. If you create a custom robots.txt file, be sure to enable it with the checkbox.

= FAQ =

* **Will my robots.txt edits remain if I disable the File Editor?**
	No. On a WordPress blog, the robots.txt file is dynamically generated just like your posts and Pages. If you disable the File Editor module or the entire SEO Ultimate plugin, the File Editor won't be able to insert your custom code into the robots.txt file anymore.

* **Will my .htaccess edits remain if I disable the File Editor?**
	Yes. The .htaccess file is static. Your edits will remain even if you disable SEO Ultimate or its File Editor module.

= Troubleshooting =

* **Why do I get a "500 Server Error" after using the File Editor?**
	You may have inserted code into your .htaccess file that your web server can't understand. As the File Editor warns, incorrectly editing your .htaccess file can disable your entire website in this way. To restore your site, you'll need to use an FTP client (or your web host's File Manager) to edit or rename your .htaccess file. If you need help, please contact your web host.

* **Where did my .htaccess edits go?**
	The .htaccess file is static, so SEO Ultimate doesn't have total control over it. It's possible that WordPress, another plugin, or other software may overwrite your .htaccess file. If you have a backup of your blog's files, you can try recovering your edits from there.



== Internal Relevance Researcher ==

= Overview =

* **What it does:** The Internal Relevance Researcher (IRR) opens Google search results in iframes based on the keywords you specify. For each keyword, IRR queries Google in this format: `site:example.com keyword`. IRR does _not_ scrape/crawl Google's search results or use other illicit automated methods; it just opens the Google search results in your browser.

* **Why it helps:** Internal Relevance Researcher lets you determine which of your webpages Google most strongly associates with the keywords you specify. You can ascertain this by observing which of your pages rank the highest for each keyword. You can then use this information to determine ideal targets for incoming links or ideal sources of outgoing links.

* **How to use it:** Enter the keywords you'd like to research, select options if desired, and then click Submit. The results will open in a new window.



== Linkbox Inserter ==

= Overview =

* **What it does:** Linkbox Inserter can add linkboxes to your posts/pages.

* **Why it helps:** Linkboxes contain HTML code that visitors can use to link to your site. This is a great way to encourage SEO-beneficial linking activity.

* **How to use it:** Use the checkboxes to enable the Linkbox Inserter in various areas of your site. Customize the HTML if desired. Click "Save Changes" when finished.


= Settings Help =

Here's information on the various settings:

* **Display linkboxes...**
	
	* **At the end of posts** -- Adds the linkbox HTML to the end of all posts (whether they're displayed on the blog homepage, in archives, or by themselves).
	
	* **At the end of pages** -- Adds the linkbox HTML to the end of all Pages.
	
	* **When called by the su_linkbox hook** -- For more fine-tuned control over where linkboxes appear, enable this option and add `<?php do_action('su_linkbox'); ?>` to your theme. You can also add an ID parameter to display the linkbox of a particular post/page; for example: `<?php do_action('su_linkbox', 123); ?>`
	
	* **HTML** -- The HTML that will be outputted to display the linkboxes. The HTML field supports these variables:
		
		* {id} -- The ID of the current post/page, or the ID passed to the action hook call.
		* {url} -- The permalink URL of the post/page.
		* {title} -- The title of the post/page.



== Meta Description Editor ==

= Overview =

* **What it does:** Meta Descriptions Editor lets you customize the text that you want to appear under your webpages' titles in search results.

* **Why it helps:** Getting ranked isn't enough; once you're ranked, you need visitors to click on your site in the results. That's where meta descriptions can help. When you provide text that makes searchers want to visit your site, you can increase your SERP clickthrough rate and thus increase search traffic.

* **How to use it:** Enter meta descriptions for your homepage, posts, pages, etc. as desired, and then click Save Changes. You can also customize the meta data of an individual post or page by using the textboxes that Meta Editor adds to the post/page editors.

= Settings Help =

Here's information on the various settings:

* **Blog Homepage Meta Description** -- When your blog homepage appears in search results, it'll have a title and a description. When you insert content into the description field below, the Meta Editor will add code to your blog homepage (the `<meta name="description" />` tag) that asks search engines to use what you've entered as the homepage's search results description.

* **Use this blog's tagline as the default homepage description.** -- If this box is checked and if the Blog Homepage Meta Description field is empty, Meta Editor will use your blog's tagline as the meta description. You can edit the blog's tagline under `Settings > General`.

= FAQ =

* **How do I edit the meta description of my homepage?**
	If you are using a "blog homepage" (the default option of showing your blog posts on your homepage), just use the Blog Homepage field.
  
	If you have configured your `Settings > Reading` section to use a "frontpage" (i.e. a Page as your homepage), just edit that Page's meta description on the "Pages" tab.

= Troubleshooting =

* **What do I do if my site has multiple meta tags?**
	First, try removing your theme's built-in meta tags if it has them. Go to `Appearance > Editor` and edit `header.php`. Delete or comment-out any `<meta>` tags.
  
	If the problem persists, try disabling other SEO plugins that may be generating meta tags.
  
	Troubleshooting tip: Go to `Settings > SEO Ultimate` and enable the "Insert comments around HTML code insertions" option. This will mark SEO Ultimate's meta tags with comments, allowing you to see which meta tags are generated by SEO Ultimate and which aren't.



== Meta Keywords Editor ==

= Overview =

Meta Keywords Editor lets you tell search engines what keywords are associated with the various pages on your site. Most modern search engines don't give meta keywords much weight, but the option is there if you want to use it. You can customize the meta keywords of an individual post or page by using the textboxes that Meta Editor adds to the post/page editors.

= Settings Help =

* **Sitewide Keywords** -- Here you can enter keywords that describe the overall subject matter of your entire blog. Use commas to separate keywords. These keywords will be put in the `<meta name="keywords" />` tags of all webpages on the site (homepage, posts, pages, archives, etc.).

* **Blog Homepage Meta Keywords** -- These keywords will be applied only to the _blog_ homepage. Note that if you've specified a "front page" under `Settings > Reading`, you'll need to edit your frontpage and set your frontpage keywords there.

= FAQ =

* **How do I edit the meta keywords of my homepage?**
	If you are using a "blog homepage" (the default option of showing your blog posts on your homepage), just use the Blog Homepage field.
	
	If you have configured your `Settings > Reading` section to use a "frontpage" (i.e. a Page as your homepage), just edit that Page under `Pages > Edit` and use the "Meta Keywords" field in the "SEO Settings" box.

* **What happens if I add a global keyword that I previously assigned to individual posts or pages?**
	Don't worry; Meta Keywords Editor will remove duplicate keywords automatically.
	
	
= Troubleshooting =

* **What do I do if my site has multiple meta tags?**
	First, try removing your theme's built-in meta tags if it has them. Go to `Appearance > Editor` and edit `header.php`. Delete or comment-out any `<meta>` tags.
  
	If the problem persists, try disabling other SEO plugins that may be generating meta tags.
  
	Troubleshooting tip: Go to `Settings > SEO Ultimate` and enable the "Insert comments around HTML code insertions" option. This will mark SEO Ultimate's meta tags with comments, allowing you to see which meta tags are generated by SEO Ultimate and which aren't.




== Meta Robot Tags Editor ==

= Overview =

* **What it does:** Meta Robot Tags Editor lets you convey instructions to search engine spiders, as well as prohibit the spiders from indexing certain webpages on your blog using the `<meta name="robots" content="noindex" />` tag.

* **Why it helps:** The "Global" tab lets you stop DMOZ or Yahoo! Directory from overriding your custom meta descriptions, as well as prevent spiders from caching your site if you so desire. The "Default Values" tab lets you deindex entire sections of your site that contain content unimportant to visitors (e.g. the administration section), or sections of your site that mostly contain duplicate content (e.g. date archives). The editor tabs can do something similar, but for individual content items. By removing webpages from search results that visitors find unhelpful, you can help increase the focus on your more useful content.

* **How to use it:** Adjust the settings as desired, and then click Save Changes. You can refer to the "Settings Help" tab for information on the settings available. You can also use the editor tabs to deindex individual content items on your site as well as enable the "nofollow" meta parameter that will nullify all outgoing links on a specific webpage.


= Settings Help =

Here's information on the various settings:

* **Global: Spider Instructions**
	
	* **Don't use this site's Open Directory / Yahoo! Directory description in search results.** -- If your site is listed in the [Open Directory (DMOZ)](http://www.dmoz.org/) or the [Yahoo! Directory](http://dir.yahoo.com/), some search engines may use your directory listing as the meta description. These boxes tell search engines not to do that and will give you full control over your meta descriptions. These settings have no effect if your site isn't listed in the Open Directory or Yahoo! Directory respectively.

	* **Don't cache or archive this site.** -- When you check this box, Meta Editor will ask search engines (Google, Yahoo!, Bing, etc.) and archivers (Archive.org, etc.) to _not_ make cached or archived "copies" of your site.

* **Default Values: Prevent indexing of...**

	* **Administration back-end pages** -- Tells spiders not to index the administration area (the part you're in now), in the unlikely event a spider somehow gains access to the administration. Recommended.

	* **Author archives** -- Tells spiders not to index author archives. Useful if your blog only has one author.

	* **Blog search pages** -- Tells spiders not to index the result pages of WordPress's blog search function. Recommended.

	* **Category archives** -- Tells spiders not to index category archives. Recommended only if you don't use categories.

	* **Comment feeds** -- Tells spiders not to index the RSS feeds that exist for every post's comments. (These comment feeds are totally separate from your normal blog feeds.)

	* **Comment subpages** -- Tells spiders not to index posts' comment subpages.

	* **Date-based archives** -- Tells spiders not to index day/month/year archives. Recommended, since these pages have little keyword value.

	* **Subpages of the homepage** -- Tells spiders not to index the homepage's subpages (page 2, page 3, etc). Recommended.

	* **Tag archives** -- Tells spiders not to index tag archives. Recommended only if you don't use tags.

	* **User login/registration pages** -- Tells spiders not to index WordPress's user login and registration pages. Recommended.

* **Editor Tabs (Posts/Pages/etc.)**

	* **Noindex** -- Checking this for an item will ask search engines to remove that item's webpage from their indices. Use this to remove pages that you don't want showing up in search results (such as a Privacy Policy page, for example).
	
	* **Nofollow** -- Checking this for an item will tell search engines to ignore the links to other webpages that are on that item's webpage. Note: this is page-level "meta nofollow," not to be confused with link-level "rel nofollow."

= Troubleshooting =

* **What do I do if my site has multiple meta tags?**
	First, try removing your theme's built-in meta tags if it has them. Go to `Appearance > Editor` and edit `header.php`. Delete or comment-out any `<meta>` tags.
  
	If the problem persists, try disabling other SEO plugins that may be generating meta tags.
  
	Troubleshooting tip: Go to `Settings > SEO Ultimate` and enable the "Insert comments around HTML code insertions" option. This will mark SEO Ultimate's meta tags with comments, allowing you to see which meta tags are generated by SEO Ultimate and which aren't.




== Module Manager ==

= Options Help =

The Module Manager lets you customize the visibility and accessibility of each module; here are the options available:

* **Enabled** -- The default option. The module will be fully enabled and accessible.
* **Silenced** -- The module will be enabled and accessible, but it won't be allowed to display numeric bubble alerts on the menu.
* **Hidden** -- The module's functionality will be enabled, but the module won't be visible on the SEO menu. You will still be able to access the module's admin page by clicking on its title in the Module Manager table.
* **Disabled** -- The module will be completely disabled and inaccessible.

= FAQ =

* **What are modules?**
	SEO Ultimate's features are divided into groups called "modules." SEO Ultimate's "Module Manager" lets you enable or disable each of these groups of features. This way, you can pick-and-choose which SEO Ultimate features you want.

* **Can I access a module again after I've hidden it?**
	Yes. Just go to the Module Manager and click the module's title to open its admin page. If you'd like to put the module back in the "SEO" menu, just re-enable the module in the Module Manager and click "Save Changes."

* **How do I disable the number bubbles on the "SEO" menu?**
	Just go to the Module Manager and select the "Silenced" option for any modules generating number bubbles. Then click "Save Changes."



== More Link Customizer ==

= Overview =

* **What it does:** More Link Customizer lets you modify the anchor text of your posts' ["more" links](http://codex.wordpress.org/Customizing_the_Read_More).

* **Why it helps:** On the typical WordPress setup, the "more link" always has the same anchor text (e.g. "Read more of this entry"). Since internal anchor text conveys web page topicality to search engines, the "read more" phrase isn't a desirable anchor phrase. More Link Customizer lets you replace the boilerplate text with a new anchor that, by default, integrates your post titles (which will ideally be keyword-oriented).

* **How to use it:** On this page you can set the anchor text you'd like to use by default. The `{post}` variable will be replaced with the post's title. HTML and encoded entities are supported. If instead you decide that you'd like to use the default anchor text specified by your currently-active theme, just erase the contents of the textbox. The anchor text can be overridden on a per-post basis via the "More Link Text" box in the "SEO Settings" section of the WordPress post editor.

= FAQ =

* **Why is the More Link Customizer an improvement over WordPress's built-in functionality?**
	Although WordPress does allow basic [custom "more" anchors](http://codex.wordpress.org/Customizing_the_Read_More#Having_a_custom_text_for_each_post), the SEO Ultimate approach has several benefits:

	* More Link Customizer (MLC) lets you set a custom default anchor text. WordPress, on the other hand, leaves this up to the currently-active theme.
	* MLC lets you dynamically incorporate the post's title into the anchor text.
	* MLC lets you include HTML tags in your anchor, whereas WordPress strips these out.
	* MLC's functionality is much more prominent than WordPress's unintuitive, barely-documented approach.
	* Unlike WordPress's method, MLC doesn't require you to utilize the HTML editor.

	If you've already specified custom anchors via WordPress's method, SEO Ultimate will import those anchors automatically into the More Link Customizer.



== Nofollow Manager ==

= Overview =

* **What it does:** Nofollow Manager adds the `rel="nofollow"` attribute to types of links that you specify. The `rel="nofollow"` attribute prevents a link from passing PageRank.

* **Why it helps:** If you're migrating to SEO Ultimate from another plugin, Nofollow Manager can help you maintain your existing settings (as part of an "if it ain't broke don't fix it" strategy). In other cases, however, we recommend not using the Nofollow Manager because in 2008 Google disabled the ability to use the `rel="nofollow"` attribute for PageRank sculpting.

* **How it works:** Select the types of links you'd like to nofollow, then click Save Changes. You can also nofollow links to individual Pages using the checkbox that Nofollow Manager adds to the "SEO Settings" box below the Page editor.


== Rich Snippet Creator ==

= Overview =

* **What it does:** Rich Snippet Creator adds special code to your posts that asks Google to display special pertinent information (known as <a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/topic.py?hl=en&topic=219">Rich Snippets</a>) in search results for certain types of content. For example, if you've written a product review, you can use Rich Snippet Creator to ask Google to display the star rating that you gave the product in your review next to your review webpage when it appears in search results.

* **Why it helps:** Rich Snippet Creator enhances the search engine results for your content by asking Google to add extra, eye-catching info that could help draw in more search engine visitors.

* **How it works:** When editing one of your posts or pages, see if your content fits one of the available rich snippet types (for example, a review). If so, select that type from the "Rich Snippet Type" dropdown box. Once you select the applicable type, additional options will appear that vary based on the type selected. For example, a "Star Rating" field will appear if you select the "Review" type.

	Once you save the post/page, Rich Snippet Creator will add the special code to it. You can remove this code at any time by selecting "None" from the "Rich Snippet Type" dropdown and resaving the post/page.

= Settings Help =

* **Data Format** -- This lets you select the "language" that Rich Snippet Creator uses to communicate the rich snippet data to Google. Google supports all three options. We recommend "Microformats" because it's compatible with the greatest number of HTML/XHTML variants. This option will likely be of interest only to advanced users.

* **Categories/Tags That Indicate Reviews** -- If you haven't set the "Rich Snippet Type" setting for an old post or page, then Rich Snippet Creator will automatically set its default type to "Review" (instead of "None") if it has a category or tag whose name is in this list (the default list is "Reviews" and "Review"). Put one category/tag name per line.

= Troubleshooting =

* **Why aren't rich snippets showing up in Google search results for my site?** -- Enter the URL of your post/page into <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets">Google's testing tool</a> to make sure Google can find the rich snippet code on your site. If no code is found, check and make sure you've enabled rich snippets for that particular post/page.

	Note that having the code on a post/page doesn't guarantee that Google will actually use it to create a rich snippet. If Google is able to read your code but isn't using it to generate rich snippets, you can ask Google to do so using <a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/request.py?contact_type=rich_snippets_feedback">this form</a>.



== Sharing Facilitator ==

= Overview =

* **What it does:** Sharing Facilitator adds buttons to your posts/pages that make it easy for visitors to share your content.

* **Why it helps:** When visitors share your content on social networking sites, this can build links to your site. Sharing Facilitator makes it easy for visitors to do this.

* **How to use it:** Pick which button type you'd like to use (ShareThis or AddThis) and click Save Changes. Try enabling each button on your site and see which one you like better.



== Slug Optimizer ==

= Overview =

* **What it does:** Slug Optimizer removes common words from the portion of a post's or Page's URL that is based on its title. (This portion is also known as the "slug.")

* **Why it helps:** Slug Optimizer increases keyword potency because there are fewer words in your URLs competing for relevance.

* **How to use it:** Slug Optimizer goes to work when you're editing a post or Page, with no action required on your part. If needed, you can use the textbox on the Slug Optimizer admin page to customize which words are removed.

= FAQ =

* **What's a slug?**
	The slug of a post or page is the portion of its URL that is based on its title.
	
	When you edit a post or Page in WordPress, the slug is the yellow-highlighted portion of the Permalink beneath the Title textbox.

* **Does the Slug Optimizer change my existing URLs?**
	No. Slug Optimizer will not relocate your content by changing existing URLs. Slug Optimizer only takes effect on new posts and pages.

* **How do I see Slug Optimizer in action?**
	1. Create a new post/Page in WordPress.
	2. Type in a title containing some common words.
	3. Click outside the Title box. WordPress will insert a URL labeled "Permalink" below the Title textbox. The Slug Optimizer will have removed the common words from the URL.

* **What if I want to include a common word in my slug?**
	When editing the post or page in question, just click the "Edit" button next to the permalink and change the slug as desired. The Slug Optimizer won't remove words from a manually-edited slug.

* **How do I revert back to the optimized slug after making changes?**
	When editing the post or page in question, just click the "Edit" button next to the permalink; a "Save" button will appear in its place. Next erase the contents of the textbox, and then click the aforementioned "Save" button.

= Troubleshooting =

* **Why didn't the Slug Optimizer remove common words from my slug?**
	It's possible that every word in your post title is in the list of words to remove. In this case, Slug Optimizer doesn't remove the words, because if it did, you'd end up with a blank slug.



== Title Tag Rewriter ==

= Overview =

* **What it does:** Title Tag Rewriter helps you customize the contents of your website's `<title>` tags. The tag contents are displayed in web browser title bars and in search engine result pages.

* **Why it helps:** Proper title rewriting ensures that the keywords in your post/Page titles have greater prominence for search engine spiders and users. This is an important foundation for WordPress SEO.

* **How to use it:** Title Tag Rewriter enables recommended settings automatically, so you shouldn't need to change anything. If you do wish to edit the rewriting formats, you can do so using the textboxes below (the "Settings & Variables" tab includes additional information on this). You also have the option of overriding the `<title>` tag of an individual post or page by using the textboxes under the "Post" and "Page" tabs below, or by using the "Title Tag" textbox that Title Tag Rewriter adds to the post/page editors.

= Formats & Variables =

Various variables, surrounded in {curly brackets}, are provided for use in the title formats. All settings support the {blog} variable, which is replaced with the name of the blog, and the {tagline} variable, which is replaced with the blog tagline as set under `Settings > General`.

Here's information on each of the settings and its supported variables:

* **Blog Homepage Title** -- Displays on the main blog posts page.

* **Post Title Format** -- Displays on single-post pages. Supports these variables:

	* {post} -- The post's title.
	* {category} -- The title of the post category with the lowest ID number.
	* {categories} -- A natural-language list of the post's categories (e.g. "Category A, Category B, and Category C").
	* {tags} -- A natural-language list of the post's tags (e.g. "Tag A, Tag B, and Tag C").

= Settings Help =

Here's documentation for the options on the "Settings" tab.

* **Rewrite Method** -- This setting controls the method by which Title Tag Rewriter edits your site's `<title>` tags.
	
	* **Use output buffering** -- This is the "traditional" method that most SEO plugins use. With this method, SEO Ultimate will intercept your site's `<head>` tag section as it's being outputted, locate the `<title>` tag, edit its value, and then output the `<head>` data. The good thing about this method is that you don't have to edit your theme in any way, as SEO Ultimate will overwrite whatever your theme puts in your `<title>` tag. The bad thing is that this output interception takes a few extra milliseconds to complete. If you are concerned about performance, are comfortable editing your theme's `header.php` file, and will remember to edit the `header.php` file of any new themes you activate, you may want to try the filtering rewrite method.
	
	* **Use filtering** -- With this method, SEO Ultimate will register itself with WordPress and will replace WordPress's `<title>` tag output with its own. This method can only edit the text that WordPress itself generates for the `<title>` tag; the filtering method can't edit anything extra your theme may add. For this reason, you need to edit your theme to make sure it's only pulling `<title>` tag data from WordPress and is not adding anything else.
		
		Here's how to set up filtering:
		1. Click "Editor" under the "Appearance" menu (if you don't see this option, you may be on a WordPress multi-site environment and may not be able to use the filtering rewrite method)
		2. Click "Header (header.php)"
		3. Look for the `<title>` start tag and the `</title>` end tag
		4. Edit the text in between those tags so that it looks like this: `<title><?php wp_title(''); ?></title>`.
		5. Click "Update File"
		6. Return to the "Settings" tab of Title Tag Rewriter, select "Use filtering," and click "Save Changes"

= FAQ =

* **Does the Title Tag Rewriter edit my post/page titles?**
	No. The Title Tag Rewriter edits the `<title>` tags of your site, not your post/page titles.

* **What's the difference between the "title" and the "title tag" of a post/page?**
	The "title" is the title of your post or page, and is displayed on your site and in your RSS feed. The title is also used in your `<title>` tag by default; however, you can override the value of just the `<title>` tag by using the "Title Tag" field in the "SEO Settings" box.
	
= Troubleshooting =

* **Why isn't Title Tag Rewriter changing my `<title>` tags?**
	Try disabling other SEO plugins, as they may be conflicting with SEO Ultimate. If you're using the default "output buffering" rewrite method, check to make sure your theme is [plugin-friendly](http://johnlamansky.com/wordpress/theme-plugin-hooks/). If you're using the "filtering" rewrite method, check your theme's `header.php` file and make sure the `<title>` tag looks like this: `<title><?php wp_title(''); ?></title>`.

== Plugin Settings ==

= Overview =

The Settings module lets you manage settings related to the SEO Ultimate plugin as a whole.

= Global Settings Help =

Here's information on some of the settings:

* **Enable nofollow'd attribution link** -- If enabled, the plugin will display an attribution link on your site.

* **Notify me about unnecessary active plugins** -- If enabled, SEO Ultimate will add notices to your "Plugins" administration page if you have any other plugins installed whose functionality SEO Ultimate replaces.

* **Insert comments around HTML code insertions** -- If enabled, SEO Ultimate will use HTML comments to identify all code it inserts into your `<head>` tag. This is useful if you&#8217;re trying to figure out whether or not SEO Ultimate is inserting a certain piece of header code.

= FAQ =

* **Why doesn't the settings exporter include all my data in an export?** -- The settings export/import system is designed to facilitate moving settings between sites. It is NOT a replacement for keeping your database backed up. The settings exporter doesn't include data that is specific to your site. For example, logged 404 errors are not included because those 404 errors only apply to your site, not another site. Also, post/page titles/meta are not included because the site into which you import the file could have totally different posts/pages located under the same ID numbers.
	
	If you're moving a site to a different server or restoring a crashed site, you should do so with database backup/restore.
