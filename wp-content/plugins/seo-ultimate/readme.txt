SEO Ultimate is an all-in-one [SEO](http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/) plugin with these powerful features:

* **Title Tag Rewriter** -- UPDATED in Version 6.8
	* Out-of-the-box functionality puts your post titles at the beginning of the `<title>` tag for improved keyword SEO.
	* Easily override the entire `<title>` tag contents for any individual post, page, attachment, category, post tag, or post format archive on your blog. Also supports custom post types and custom taxonomies.
	* Customize your homepage's `<title>` tag.
	* Format the `<title>` tags of posts, pages, categories, tags, archives, search results, and more!
	* Choose between two rewrite methods: "output buffering" or "filtering"

* **Meta Description Editor**
	* Edit the `<meta>` description tags for posts, pages, attachments, categories, tags, post format archives, and the homepage.
	* Increase SERP clickthrough rates by influencing search engine result snippets.
	* Mass-editor makes it a cinch to go back and add descriptions to old posts.
	* Use the `{excerpt::autogen}` variable to auto-generate meta descriptions if desired.

* **Meta Keywords Editor**
	* Edit the `<meta>` keyword tags for posts, pages, categories, terms, and the homepage.
	* Easily specify global keywords that are applied across the entire site.
	* Go back and edit old posts' and pages' keywords with the mass-editor.
	* Automatically generate meta keywords based on categories, tags, custom taxonomy terms, and frequently-used words.

* **Meta Robot Tags Editor**
	* Add the `<meta name="robots" content="noindex,follow" />` tag to archives, comment feeds, the login page, and more.
	* Set meta robots tags (index/noindex and follow/nofollow) for each individual post, page, category, tag, and post type archive on your blog. Also supports custom post types and custom taxonomies.
	* Avoid duplicate content SEO issues with the recommended noindex settings (see built-in module documentation for details).
	* Give instructions to search engine spiders if desired (`noodp`, `noydir`, and `noarchive`).

* **Deeplink Juggernaut** -- UPDATED in Version 6.7
	* Use the power of anchor text to boost your internal ranking SEO paradigm.
	* Searches your site's content for anchor texts you specify and automatically links them to a destination of your choosing. Lets you easily build internal links to URLs, posts, pages, attachments, custom post type items, categories, terms, post format archives, and custom taxonomy term archives.
	* Customize footer links for your entire site and/or on a page-by-page basis.
	* Easily select autolink destinations using autocomplete textboxes that scour your site's content and taxonomy terms to find the link destination you're looking for.
	* Autolinks point to the objects themselves, not to their URLs, so if you change the URL of a post or category on your site, the autolinks automatically adjust.
	* Avoid over-optimization penalties by controlling the maximum number of autolinks added to each post/page, the maximum number of times an anchor is linked per post/page, and/or the maximum number of times a post/page can link to the same destination.
	* Decide how many times each anchor is linked across your entire site, on a per-link or global basis.
	* Choose whether or not posts can link to themselves and/or to the current URL with a few simple checkboxes.
	* Apply the nofollow attribute on a per-link basis. (Perfect for automatic affiliate links.)
	* Exclude specific posts/pages from having links added to them, if desired (e.g. contact pages, the homepage, etc.).
	* Import/export your links as CSV files.
	* Create links pointing to draft posts that will auto-enable when the post is published!
	* Build internal links to your posts from within the WordPress post editor! Use "Instant Post Propulsion" technology to automatically link your old posts to new ones.
	* Lets you enable "Silo Linking" mode so that posts only link to other posts in the same category.

* **Canonicalizer**
	* Point search engines to preferred content access points with `<link rel="canonical" />` head tags and/or `Link: <url>; rel="canonical"` HTTP headers.
	* Go beyond the basic canonical tag functionality of WordPress 2.9+ with SEO Ultimate's support for category/tag/date/author archives.
	* Redirect requests for non-existent pagination with a simple checkbox.

* **404 Monitor**
	* Improve the visiting experience of users and spiders by keeping tabs on "page not found" errors. (Use a redirection plugin to point dead-end URLs to your content.)
	* Find out what URLs are referring visitors to 404 errors.
	* The default settings hone in on the most important errors by only logging 404s that either have a referring URL or are generated by a search engine spider.
	* If desired, ignore 404s generated from specific URLs or wildcard URL patterns.

* **Linkbox Inserter**
	* Encourage natural linkbuilding activity by adding textboxes to the end of your posts/pages that contain automatically-generated link HTML.

* **File Editor**
	* Implement advanced SEO strategies with the `.htaccess` editor.
	* Give instructions to search engines via the `robots.txt` editor.

* **Slug Optimizer**
	* Increase in-URL keyword potency by removing "filler words" (like "the," "with," "and," etc.) from post/page URLs.
	* Lets you customize the "filler words" list as desired.

* **Competition Researcher**
	* Investigate multiple keywords or URLs with quick access to search engine tools. Competition Researcher does this without illicit scraping/automation methods.

	* Find out what external websites your competitors are linking to.

* **More Link Customizer**

	* Override the "read more" link on a per-post basis.
	* Include `<strong>` or `<em>` tags in the anchor text if so desired.

* **Internal Relevance Researcher**
	* Determine which of your webpages Google most strongly associates with the keywords you specify.
	* Use the information to determine ideal targets for incoming links or ideal sources of outgoing links.

* **Code Inserter**
	* Easily insert custom HTML into your site's `<head>` tag, footer, or item content.
	* Use to add Google Analytics, Feedburner FeedFlare, Google AdSense section targeting, and other SEO/SEM-enhancing code snippets.
	* Code remains even when switching themes.

* **Rich Snippet Creator**

	* Choose from either the ShareThis or the AddThis button.
	* Unlike the official ShareThis plugin, SEO Ultimate doesn't require you to register at the ShareThis website before enabling the button -- just enable and go.

* **Webmaster Verification Assistant**
	* Enter verification codes in the provided fields to access search engine webmaster tools.

* **Link Mask Generator**
	* Lets you generate robots.txt-blocked "link masks" (e.g. `www.example.com/go/google/`) that pass-through to an external URL.
	* Lets you mask links on a per-link, per-post basis so you can exert fine-tuned control over your posts' linkflow.
	* Lets you change `/go/` to a directory of your choosing.
	* Link masks provide a modern replacement for the deprecated, nofollow-based "PageRank Sculpting" technique.
	* Perfect for affiliate marketers and SEO-savvy bloggers.

* **Nofollow Manager**
	* Lets you maintain `rel="nofollow"` settings when migrating from other SEO plugins

* **Permalink Tweaker**
	* Lets you remove the permalink base for categories, tags, and/or custom taxonomies. For example, enable category base removal to convert `http://example.com/category/example` into `http://example.com/example`, and then pair that with a `/%category%/%postname%/` permalink to enable some serious SEO siloing action.

* **SEO Ultimate Widgets** -- NEW in Version 6.6

	* The Siloed Categories widget makes it drag-and-drop-easy to construct siloed navigation on your site

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Troubleshooting =

* **I installed SEO Ultimate and my site broke. What do I do?**
	If you get an error message or your screen goes blank after you activate SEO Ultimate, it's likely because your site ran out of memory. A common site memory limit is 32 megabytes. SEO Ultimate uses only 5 megabytes of memory, but combined with WordPress and your other plugins, you may be running over the limit. Try increasing your memory limit to "64M" (64 megabytes) [in your wp-config.php file](http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#Increasing_memory_allocated_to_PHP), or contact your web host for assistance. (Note: The amount of site memory has nothing to do with the amount of your computer's memory.)

* **I upgraded SEO Ultimate and something broke. What do I do?**
	If a new version of SEO Ultimate introduces a bug, you can easily revert back to the previous version you were using. Just go to the `Settings > SEO Ultimate` page and click on the "Downgrade" tab. (Downgrading is available most of the time, but if the new version upgraded the plugin's settings infrastructure, SEO Ultimate won't let you downgrade, since doing so would cause you to lose your settings. There may be other cases in which downgrading isn't available or causes problems; it's an unsupported feature, but should work in most cases.)

= General FAQ =

* **Why "SEO Ultimate" instead of "Ultimate SEO"?**
	Because "SEO Ultimate" works better as a brand name.

* **Where in WordPress does the plugin add itself?**
	SEO Ultimate puts all its admin pages under a new "SEO" top-level menu. The only exception is the plugin settings page, which goes under `Settings > SEO Ultimate`.

* **Where's the documentation?**
	SEO Ultimate's documentation is built into the plugin itself. Whenever you're viewing an SEO Ultimate page in your WordPress admin, you can click the "Help" tab in the upper-right-hand corner to view documentation for the area you're viewing.

* **How do I disable the attribution link?**
	The attribution link is disabled by default. It only appears if you enable it. You can re-disable it the same place you enabled it: under `Settings > SEO Ultimate`.

* **How do I uninstall SEO Ultimate?**
	1. Go to the `Settings > SEO Ultimate` admin page and click the "Uninstall" tab.
	2. Click the "Uninstall Now" button and click "Yes" to confirm. SEO Ultimate's files and database entries will be deleted.

* **Will all my settings be deleted if I delete SEO Ultimate in the Plugins manager?**
	No. Your settings will be retained unless you uninstall SEO Ultimate under `Settings > SEO Ultimate > Uninstall`.

* **Where is the Plugin Settings page?**
	The plugin settings page is located under `Settings > SEO Ultimate`.

= "SEO Settings" box =

* **Where is the SEO Settings box located?**
	The SEO Settings box is located on WordPress's post/page editor underneath the content area.

* **How do I disable the "SEO Settings" box in the post/page editors?**
	Open the editor, click the "Screen Options" tab in the upper-right-hand corner, and uncheck the "SEO Settings" checkbox. Note that the box's visibility is a per-user preference.

* **Why did some of the textboxes disappear from the "SEO Settings" box?**
	The "SEO Settings" fields are added by your modules. The "Title Tag" field is added by the Title Tag Rewriter module, the "Description" and "Keywords" fields are added by the Meta Editor module, etc. If you disable a module using the Module Manager, its fields in the "SEO Settings" box will be disabled too. You can re-enable the field in question by re-enabling the corresponding module.


= Module FAQ =

Frequently asked questions, settings help, and troubleshooting tips for SEO Ultimate's modules can be found by clicking the help tabs in the upper-right-hand corner of the module admin pages themselves. The same documentation can also be found in the `seo-ultimate/modules/documentation.txt` file of the SEO Ultimate download.
